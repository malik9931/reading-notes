## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
We are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.

Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

Block-level Elements start on a new line Examples include:

Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include:
elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.) 

Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling). 

CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
