Espresso is a testing framework for Android to make it easy to write reliable user interface tests.

Espresso has basically three components:
ViewMatchers - allows to find view in the current view hierarchy.
ViewActions - allows to perform actions on the views.
ViewAssertions - allows to assert state of a view.




Espresso Test Recorder tool - lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. Takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app. Writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test.
