# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

# jQuery

All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.
jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element.

$("button").addClass("animated bounce");

You can download a copy of the jQuery library from www.jquery.com, or, as an alternative, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network), like Google or Microsoft.

To start using jQuery, we first need to add it to the head of our HTML document using the script tag:
``` <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script> ```
