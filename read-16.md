# Spring Security Architecture


**Spring Security Architecture**

###### Authentication (who are you?)
###### Authorization (what are you allowed to do?).

 * Authentication and Access Control
   - Two problems of app security: authentication and authorization 
   - Authentication - main strategy interface for authentication is AuthenticationManager
     * AuthenticationManager can do one of 3 things in its authenticate() method: 
       - Return an Authentication if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.
       - Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.
       - Return null if it cannot decide.
     * AuthenticationException is a runtime exception, and its usually handled by an application in a generic way, depending on the style or purpose of the application.
     * Customizing Authentication Managers
      - Spring Security provides some configuration helpers to quickly get common authentication manager features set up in your application, and the most common one is AuthenticationManagerBuilder.
      - AuthenticationManagerBuilder - or setting up in-memory, JDBC, or LDAP user details or for adding a custom UserDetailsService
    *  Authorization or Access Control
      - Authorization - core strategy here is to use the AccessDecisionManager. There are three implementations provided by the framework and all three delegate to a chain of AccessDecisionVoter instances.
      - AccessDecisionVoter considers an Authentication and a secure Object, which has ConfigAttributes.
  * Web Security

    - Spring Security in the web tier is based on Servlet Filters.
    - The typical layering of the handlers for a single HTTP request client sends a request to the application, and the container decides which filters and which servlet apply to it based on the path of the request URI.
    - Filters form a chain and the order of the chain are important, and a servlet can handle one request.
    - Filter can veto the rest of the chain if it wants to handle the request itself, and a filter can also modify the request or the response used in the downstream filters and servlet. 
    - Spring Boot manages the filter chain through two mechanisms: @Beans of type Filter can have an @Order or implement Ordered
    - Spring Security is installed as a single Filter in the chain, and its concrete type is FilterChainProxy. Inside of the single filter there are additional filters.
    - Another layer of indirection in the security filter, and its usually installed in the container as a DelegatingFilterProxy, which does not have to be a Spring @Bean. 
    - Can be multiple filter chains all managed by Spring Security in the same top level FilterChainProxy and all are unknown to the container. 
  * Creating and Customizing Filter Chains
    - default fallback filter chain in a Spring Boot application (the one with the /** request matcher) has a predefined order of SecurityProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER
    - can switch it off completely by setting security.basic.enabled=false
    - or you can use it as a fallback and define other rules with a lower order by add a @Bean of type WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter or WebSecurityConfigurer and decorate the class with @Order 
  * Request Matching for Dispatch and Authorization 
    - Security filter chain has a request matcher that is used to decide whether to apply it to an HTTP request, once the decision is made to apply a particular filter chain, no others are applied. 
    - You can have more fine-grained control of authorization by setting additional matchers in the HttpSecurity
  * Combining Application Security Rules with Actuator Rules
    - Add the Actuator to a secure application, which adds an additional filter chain that applies only to the actuator endpoints. It is defined with a request matcher that matches only actuator endpoints and it has an order of ManagementServerProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER.
  * Method Security
    - Spring Security offers support for applying access rules to Java method executions. For users the access rules are declared using the same format of ConfigAttribute strings, but in a different place in the code.
  * Working with Threads
    - Spring Security is thread-bound because it needs to make the current authenticated principal available to a wide variety of downstream consumers. 
    - Basic building block is the SecurityContext, which may contain an Authentication, and you can always access and manipulate the SecurityContext through static convenience methods in SecurityContextHolder, which manipulate a ThreadLocal.
  * Processing Secure Methods Asynchronously
    - SecurityContext is thread-bound, so if you want to do any background processing that calls secure methods, you need to ensure that the context is propagated. 


**Spring Auth Cheat Sheet**
 * Step 1 - set up a user model and repo
 * Step 2 - create a controller for that model
 * Step 3 - UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService - gets a User from the database by username 
 * Step 4 - ApplicationUser implements UserDetails - use IntelliJ to implement the methods; make the boolean ones all return true
 * Step 5 - WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter - has a UserDetailsService, passwordEncoder bean, configure AuthManagerBuilde, and configure HttpSecurity
 * Step 6 - registration page - create it w/ form, ensure it posts to a route your controller is ready for, and check it's saving in the DB
 * Step 7 - login page - create it w/ form,
ensure it posts to the route you specified in, web config, try it out, and add to a template w/ things about the Principal
