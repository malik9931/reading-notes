## Java Basics
Basics of the language: variables, operators, expressions, statements, blocks, control flow statements.

Variables: instance (non-static), class (static), local, and parameters

Primitive: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

Expressions: "a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value."

Statements: "A statement forms a complete unit of execution."

Blocks = within braces

Control Flow: if, then, else, switch
