### How the Web Works:
When you visit a website, the web serverhosting that site could be anywhere in theworld. In order for you to find the location ofthe web server, your browser will first connectto a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

### STRUCTURE:

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

1. Specifying different versions of HTML
2. Identifying and grouping elements
3. Comments, meta information and iframes

Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using


Use this to add comments:
<!-- comment goes here -->
<p id="pullquote">the text will be here </p>
It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes.

The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.



#### The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).


### Process & Design

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find, and when they are likely to return.


Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
