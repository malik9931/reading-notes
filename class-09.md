## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

'''
<form>
.
form elements
.
</form>
'''

Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.



Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

<table class="w3-table-all">
 <tbody><tr>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</td>
  <td>Displays a single-line text input field</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</td>
  <td>Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</td>
  <td>Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</td>
  <td>Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&lt;input type="button"&gt;</td>
  <td>Displays a clickable button</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody></table>
 
 
 ## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)
 
There are several CSS properties that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
