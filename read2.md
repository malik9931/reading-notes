# Staring with JavaScript

### It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

### The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file

If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

#### Statements are used in JavaScript to control its program flow.

#### Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.

### EX: document.write(‘Good Evning’);

#### Every statement end by ;

#### The pink curly braces indicate the start and end of a code block. (Each code block could contain many more statements.)

### JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE


#### Comments:

/* for
Multi – line
Comments*/

// for one line comment


#### Defining Variable:
var nameOfVariable;
nameOfVariable = something (string , number, boolean);
