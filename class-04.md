## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
Linking to Other Sites:
<a href="Put URL here">the name of website or page</a>
Ex:
<a href="http://www.empireonline.com">Empire</a>

Ex:
<a href="index.html">Home</a>

Email Links:
Ex:
<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>


Opening Links in a New Window:
<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">

Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page:
<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br />

Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page:

## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
We are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.

Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

Block-level 
Elements start on a new line 
Examples include:
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>

Inline elements
flow in between surrounding text
Examples include:<img> <b> <i>

XX <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

X The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

XX Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

XX CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
