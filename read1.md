# Process & Design:

## This chpter talks about:
- How to approach building a site
- Understanding your audience and their needs
- How to present information visitors want to see

## There some question I have to answer it before starting designing my website:
-	Who is the Site For? (Target Audience: Individuals or Companies)
-	Why People Visit YOUR Website? (Key Motivations & Specific Goals)
-	What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
-	What Information Your Visitors Need?
-	How Often People Will Visit Your Site?

### Site Maps: 
a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.
(you can use a technique called card sorting.)


### WireFrames:
The wireframe: should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.

Online wireframe tools such as those at:

##### The designer needs to organize and prioritize the information to communicate their message and help users find what they're looking for.

##### In my Website I should take care for:
- visual hierarchy              
- Grouping              
- Similarity



##### When I want to Design a Navigation: Concise, Clear and Selective. 


# HTML5 Layout

### This chapter talks about:
- HTML5 layout elements
- How old browsers understand new elements
- Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS

This chapter talks about the layers of HTML5 and says that the new layer play their own roles, meaning that each element has a goal.

The new elements introduced by HTML5 perform specific and clear functions compared to the multiple functions performed by the <div> elements

Old browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to re-define what the Block LEVL elements.


#  Extra Markup

- Specifying different versions of HTML
- Identifying and grouping elements
- Comments, meta information and iframes

Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes.

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

Use this to add comments:
<!-- comment goes here -->


<p id="pullquote">the text will be here </p>
It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes.

The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.
