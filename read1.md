#Process & Design:

This chpter talks about:
- How to approach building a site
- Understanding your audience and their needs
- How to present information visitors want to see

## There some question I have to answer it before starting designing my website:
-	Who is the Site For? (Target Audience: Individuals or Companies)
-	Why People Visit YOUR Website? (Key Motivations & Specific Goals)
-	What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
-	What Information Your Visitors Need?
-	How Often People Will Visit Your Site?

### Site Maps: 
a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.
(you can use a technique called card sorting.)


### WireFrames:
The wireframe: should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.

Online wireframe tools such as those at:

##### The designer needs to organize and prioritize the information to communicate their message and help users find what they're looking for.

##### In my Website I should take care for:
- visual hierarchy              
- Grouping              
- Similarity



##### When I want to Design a Navigation: Concise, Clear and Selective.
