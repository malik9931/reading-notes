### “Object Literals” (pp.100-105):

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

''' var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; '''


An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
