## The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

  * This article called "The code I'm still ashamed of" by Bill Sourour was about his experience of writting code for pharmaceutical company that was selling a particular drug. He somewhat blames himself for helping to promote that drug because he helped to build the website that promoted it, and wishes he had never taken part in building that website. He didn't know anything about the drug, and should of looked into what he was helping to advertise before creating the quiz, but he was just starting out working there, and had to code what he was asked to code. I would make sure to look into what I am coding before I code it, and make sure whatever it is I am helping to advertise will not cause harm to others. 

## Self Driving Car Ethics

  * This article is called "Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?
", and it was written by Todd Spangler. This article is about the ethics of self driving cars, and how we should deal with the many issues that self driving cars can cause in a no win situations, such as in a potentional car accident where a desion must be made by the self driving car, since the human in the car can't react fast enough to regain control of the vehicle. Since this technology has not been perfected yet and still needs a lot of improvement, I don't think its a good idea to have cars that are totally self driving yet. Someday this technology will help to prevent car accidents, and make the roads a bit safer, but until the technology has become better equipt to deal with such situations I think its best to not have the technology become main stream yet.
